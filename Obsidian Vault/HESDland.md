""Â I would recommend having someone look in to loading the photos via AJAX instead of on site load. This would let your site load almost instantly, and then the photos can load in the background. From the user experience, they would think everything was loaded, as the pictures would be downloaded before they viewed them. But most of the "heavy lifting" would happen after the user was at the site already. I think it would give a much better user experience ""
